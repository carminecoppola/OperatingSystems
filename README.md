# Operating Systems

This repository contains a collection of exercises related to Operating Systems, completed during the Operating Systems course at Parthenope University of Naples. The exercises cover topics such as threads, pipes, synchronization, and more.

## How to Use This Repository

To use the exercises, you need to have a properly configured C development environment on your computer. Here are the preliminary steps:

1. Installation of GCC: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a widely used C compiler. Check if GCC is already installed on your system by running the following command in a terminal window:
  `gcc --version`
If GCC is already installed, you should see the installed version. Otherwise, follow the appropriate instructions to install GCC on your operating system.
2. Compiling the files: After cloning the repository to your computer, you can compile the C files using GCC. Make sure you are in the correct directory, then execute the following command to compile a sample C file called "exercise.c":
  `gcc -o exercise exercise.c`
This command will create an executable file named "exercise". To run the program, type:
  `./exercise`
Make sure to adapt the compilation and execution commands to the specifications of your operating system.
